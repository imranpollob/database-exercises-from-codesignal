## 16. newsSubscribers

You are managing a small newspaper subscription service. Anyone who uses it can subscribe to a large number of different newspapers for a full year or just a half year.

The information about subscriptions is stored in the  **full_year**  and  **half_year**  tables, which have the following structures:

-   **full_year**:
    -   `id`: the unique subscription ID;
    -   `newspaper`: the newspaper's name;
    -   `subscriber`: the name of the subscriber.
-   **half_year**
    -   `id`: the unique subscription ID;
    -   `newspaper`: the newspaper's name;
    -   `subscriber`: the name of the subscriber.

Given the  **full_year**  and  **half_year**  tables, compose the result as follows: The resulting table should have one column  `subscriber`  that contains all the  _distinct_names of anyone who is subscribed to a newspaper with the word  `Daily`  in its name. The table should be sorted in ascending order by the subscribers' first names.

Example

The following tables  **full_year**

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>newspaper</th>
<th>subscriber</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>The Paragon Herald</td>
  <td>Crissy Sepe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>The Daily Reporter</td>
  <td>Tonie Moreton</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>Morningtide Daily</td>
  <td>Erwin Chitty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>Daily Breakfast</td>
  <td>Tonie Moreton</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>5</td>
  <td>Independent Weekly</td>
  <td>Lavelle Phu</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

and **half_year**

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>newspaper</th>
<th>subscriber</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>The Daily Reporter</td>
  <td>Lavelle Phu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>Daily Breakfast</td>
  <td>Tonie Moreton</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>The Paragon Herald</td>
  <td>Lia Cover</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>The Community Gazette</td>
  <td>Lavelle Phu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>5</td>
  <td>Nova Daily</td>
  <td>Lia Cover</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>6</td>
  <td>Nova Daily</td>
  <td>Joya Buss</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

the output should be

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>subscriber</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Erwin Chitty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Joya Buss</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Lavelle Phu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Lia Cover</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Tonie Moreton</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
