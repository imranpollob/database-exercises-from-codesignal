## 14. testCheck

Your professor gave the class a bonus task: Write a program that will check the answers for the latest test. The program will be given a table  **answers**  with the following columns:

-   `id`  - the unique ID of the question;
-   `correct_answer`  - the correct answer to the question, given as a string;
-   `given_answer`  - the answer given to the question, which can be NULL.

Your task is to return the table with a column  `id`  and a column  `checks`, where for each  **answers**  `id`  the following string should be returned:

-   `"no answer"`  if the  `given_answer`  is empty;
-   `"correct"`  if the  `given_answer`  is the same as the  `correct_answer`;
-   `"incorrect"`  if the  `given_answer`  is not empty and is incorrect.

Order the records in the answer table by  `id`.

Example

For given table  **answers**


<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>correct_answer</th>
<th>given_answer</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>a</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>NULL</td> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>b</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

the output should be

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>checks</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>correct</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>no answer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>incorrect</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

## Solution
```sql
SELECT id,
IF ( given_answer = correct_answer, 'correct', IF (isnull(given_answer), 'no answer', 'incorrect') )
AS checks
FROM answers
ORDER BY id;

SELECT id, 
IF ( given_answer is null, 'no answer', IF (correct_answer = given_answer, 'correct', 'incorrect') )
AS checks
FROM answers
ORDER BY id;
```
