## 9. gradeDistribution


At the end of every semester your professor for "Introduction to Databases" saves the exam results of every student in a simple database system. In the database table  **Grades**, there are five columns:

-   **Name**: the name of the student;
-   **ID**: the student's ID number (a 5 byte positive integer);
-   **Midterm1**: the result of the first midterm out of 100 points;
-   **Midterm2**: the result of the second midterm out of 100 points;
-   **Final**: the result of the final exam, this time out of a possible 200 points.

According to school policy, there are three possible ways to evaluate a grade:

-   Option 1:
    -   Midterm 1: 25% of the grade
    -   Midterm 2: 25% of the grade
    -   Final exam: 50% of the grade
-   Option 2:
    -   Midterm 1: 50% of the grade
    -   Midterm 2: 50% of the grade
-   Option 3:
    -   Final exam: 100% of the grade.

Each student's final grade comes from the option that works the best for that student.

As a Teaching Assistant (TA), you need to  **query**  the  **name**and  **id**  of all the students whose best grade comes from  **Option 3**, sorted based on the first 3 characters of their name. If the first 3 characters of two names are the same, then the student with the lower ID value comes first.

**Example**

For the following table  **Grades**

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>ID</td>
    <td>Midterm1</td>
    <td>Midterm2</td>
    <td>Final</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>David</td>
    <td>42334</td>
    <td>34</td>
    <td>54</td>
    <td>124</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Anthony</td>
    <td>54528</td>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jonathan</td>
    <td>58754</td>
    <td>49</td>
    <td>58</td>
    <td>121</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jonty</td>
    <td>11000</td>
    <td>25</td>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>180</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

the output should be

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>ID</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>David</td>
    <td>42334</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jonty</td>
    <td>11000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jonathan</td>
    <td>58754</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

For David, Jonty and Jonathan, the best option is number 3. But Anthony's best option is the second one, because **Option1 = 25% of 100 + 25% of 10 +50% of 50 = 52.5**, **Option2 = 50% of 100 + 50% of 10 = 55**, **Option3 = 100% of 50 = 50**.

## Solution
```sql
select Name, ID from Grades
where Final > (Midterm1 + Midterm2) / 2
order by left(Name, 3), ID;

select Name, ID from Grades
where final > 0.25*midterm1 + 0.25*midterm2 + 0.5*final and 
final > 0.5*midterm1 + 0.5*midterm2
order by left(name,3), id;

select Name, ID
from Grades 
where Final > greatest(Midterm1 / 4 + Midterm2 / 4 + Final / 2 , Midterm1 / 2 + Midterm2 / 2)
order by left(Name, 3), ID;

select temp.name as "Name", temp.ID as "ID" from
(SELECT name, ID, 
(Midterm1 * .25) + (Midterm2 * .25) + (Final * .50) as option1,
(Midterm1 * .50) + (Midterm2 * .50) as option2,
Final as option3 FROM Grades) temp 
where temp.option3 > temp.option2 and 
temp.option3 > temp.option1 
order by substring(temp.name,1,3) asc, temp.ID asc;
```
