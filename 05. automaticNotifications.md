## 5. automaticNotifications


The application you've been working on for the past year is a huge success! It already has a large and active user community. You know the ID number, username, and email of each user. Each user also has a specific role that shows their position in the community. Information about the users is stored in the database as a table  **users**, which has the following structure:

-   `id`: the unique user ID;
-   `username`: the username of the user;
-   `role`  the user's role;
-   `email`: the user's email.

You want to send users automatic notifications to let them know about the most recent updates. However, not all users should get these notifications: Administrators don't need notifications since they know about the updates already, and premium users don't need them since they get personalized weekly updates.

Given the  **users**  table, your task is to return the emails of all the users who should get notifications, i.e. those whose  `role`  is not equal to  `"admin"`  or  `"premium"`. Note that roles are case insensitive, so users with  `role`s of  `"Admin"`,  `"pReMiUm"`, etc. should also be excluded.

The resulting table should contain a single  `email`  column and be sorted by  `email`s in ascending order.

**Example**

For the following table  **users**
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>username</th>
<th>role</th>
<th>email</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>fasalytch</td>
<td>premium</td>
<td>much.premium@role.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>13</td>
<td>luckygirl</td>
<td>regular</td>
<td>fun@meh.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>16</td>
<td>todayhumor</td>
<td>guru</td>
<td>today@humor.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>23</td>
<td>Felix</td>
<td>admin</td>
<td>felix@codesignal.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>52</td>
<td>admin666</td>
<td>AdmiN</td>
<td>iamtheadmin@admin.admin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>87</td>
<td>solver100500</td>
<td>regular</td>
<td>email@notbot.com</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

the output should be

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>email</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>email@notbot.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fun@meh.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>today@humor.com</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

The only three users who should get notifications are `luckygirl`, `todayhumor`, and `solver100500`. Their emails are `fun@meh.com`, `today@humor.com`, and `email@notbot.com`respectively, which should be sorted as `email@notbot.com`, `fun@meh.com`, and `today@humor.com`.
