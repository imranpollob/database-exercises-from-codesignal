## 3. monthlyScholarships
Students at your university get scholarships that are paid out throughout the year.

Information about the scholarships is stored in the table  **scholarships**, which has the structure:

-   `id`: the unique student id;
-   `scholarship`: the amount of the annual scholarship the student has been awarded.

Now you need to calculate the amount of money each student should get per month. Given the table  **scholarships**, build the resulting table as follows: The table should have the same columns as the initial table, but the  `scholarship`  column should contain the amount of the student's monthly scholarship payout. The rows should be ordered by the students'  `id`s.

**Example**

For the following table  **scholarships**
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>id</th>
    <th>scholarship</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>12000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>18000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>24000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>15000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>21000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>13000</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
the output should be
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>scholarship</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>1500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>2000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>1250</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>1750</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>1083.3333333333333</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
