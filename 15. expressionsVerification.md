## 15. expressionsVerification

You're a math teacher at an elementary school. Today you taught your class basic arithmetic operations (`"+"`,  `"-"`,  `"*"`,  `"/"`) and now you need to give the students some homework. You have a lot of expressions in the format  `a <operation> b = c`, where  `a`,  `b`, and  `c`  are some integers and  `operation`  is one of the operations given above.

Information about these expressions is stored in the table  **expressions**, which has the structure:

-   `id`: the unique operation id;
-   `a`: an integer;
-   `b`: an integer;
-   `operation`: one of the operations given above (`"+"`,  `"-"`,  `"*"`, or  `"/"`);
-   `c`: an integer.

The homework you're going to give is simple: For each expression, the student needs to determine whether it's correct or not, i.e. whether it's true that the expression to the left of the  `=`  sign equals  `c`.

Since you have many students and checking all their answers manually is a lot of work, you want to streamline the process by automatically identifying all the expressions that are correct. Given the table  **expressions**, build the resulting table as follows: The table should have the same columns as the initial table does, but it should only contain those rows that represent correct expressions. The rows should be ordered by  `id`.

Example

For the following table  **expressions**
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>id</th>
    <th>a</th>
    <th>b</th>
    <th>operation</th>
    <th>c</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>+</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>+</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>/</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>*</td>
    <td>28</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>54</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>27</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>/</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

the output should be

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>id</th>
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
<th>operation</th>
<th>c</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>+</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>*</td>
<td>28</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

## Solution
```sql
select * from expressions 
where (operation = '+' and c=a+b) or
(operation = '-' and c=a-b) or
(operation = '*' and c=a*b) or
(operation = '/' and c=a/b)
order by id;

SELECT * FROM expressions
WHERE CASE operation
    WHEN '+' THEN a + b
    WHEN '-' THEN a - b
    WHEN '*' THEN a * b
    WHEN '/' THEN a / b
  END = c
ORDER BY id;

SELECT * FROM expressions
WHERE ELT( LOCATE(operation, "+-*/"), a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b ) = c
ORDER BY id;
```

### Note: 

__LOCATE( search str, str, [position] )__ returns the position of the first occurrence of a string within a string.  An optional argument may be used to specify from which position of the string  searching will start.

__ELT( index number, string1, string2, string3, â€¦ )__ returns the string at the index number specified in the list of arguments. It returns NULL when the index number is less than 1 or index number is greater than the number of the string specified as arguments.

According to Wikipedia ELT stands for Extract, Load, Transform (ELT), a data manipulation process.
