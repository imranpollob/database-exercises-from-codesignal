## 10. mischievousNephews

Your nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie are staying with you over the winter holidays. Ever since they arrived, you've hardly had a day go by without some kind of incident - the little rascals do whatever they please! Actually, you're not even mad; the ideas they come up with are pretty amazing, and it looks like there's even a system to their mischief.

You decided to track and analyze their behavior, so you created the  **mischief**  table in your local database. The table has the following columns:

-   `mischief_date`: the date of the mischief (of the  `date`type);
-   `author`: the nephew who caused the mischief (`"Huey"`,  `"Dewey"`  or  `"Louie"`);
-   `title`: the title of the mischief.

It looks like each of your nephews is active on a specific day of the week. You decide to check your theory by creating another table as follows:  
The resulting table should contain four columns,  `weekday`,  `mischief_date`,  `author`, and  `title`, where  `weekday`  is the weekday of  `mischief_date`  (`0`  for Monday,  `1`  for Tuesday, and so on, with  `6`  for Sunday). The table should be sorted by the  `weekday`  column, and for each  `weekday`  Huey's mischief should go first, Dewey's should go next, and Louie's should go last. In case of a tie,  `mischief_date`  should be a tie-breaker. If there's still a tie, the record with the  lexicographically smallest  `title`  should go first.

It is guaranteed that all entries of  **mischief**  are unique.

**Example**

For the following table  **mischief**

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>mischief_date</th>
<th>author</th>
<th>title</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2016-12-01</td>
<td>Dewey</td>
<td>Cook the golden fish in a bucket</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2016-12-01</td>
<td>Dewey</td>
<td>Paint the walls pink</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2016-12-01</td>
<td>Huey</td>
<td>Eat all the candies</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2016-12-01</td>
<td>Louie</td>
<td>Wrap the cat in toilet paper</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2016-12-08</td>
<td>Louie</td>
<td>Play hockey on linoleum</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2017-01-01</td>
<td>Huey</td>
<td>Smash a window</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2017-02-06</td>
<td>Dewey</td>
<td>Create a rink on the porch</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

the output should be

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>weekday</th>
<th>mischief_date</th>

<th>title</th>

<tr>
<td>0</td>

<td>Dewey</td>
